     • Tree 2: Secondary tree at position [10, -2, -5], scale 2.5
     • Both loaded from GLB files (3D model format)
     • Uses Suspense for lazy loading

  c) Memory Orbs (Spheres):
     • One sphere created for each memory in the state
     • Positioned in circular arc around the main tree
     • Position calculation:
       X: Math.sin(index) * 4    (horizontal arc)
       Y: 2 + (index * 0.5)      (climbing effect)
       Z: Math.cos(index) * 4    (depth arc)
     • Color based on memory type:
       Happy → Green (#4ade80)

       - Arrow Down / S: Move backward  
       - Arrow Left / A: Move left
       - Arrow Right / D: Move right
       - Movement speed: 0.3 units per frame
     • Mouse Controls (OrbitControls):
       - Left mouse drag: Rotate camera view
       - Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
       - Min distance: 15 units (can't zoom in too close)
       - Max distance: 60 units (can't zoom out too far)
       - Max polar angle: ~85 degrees (prevents upside-down view)
     • Game-like Navigation: Users can freely explore the forest using
       keyboard movement while simultaneously adjusting their view angle
       with mouse controls for an immersive experience

MEMORY DATA STRUCTURE
================================================================================
Each memory object contains:

{
  id: Number (timestamp when created),
  title: String (e.g., "First Day"),
  date: String (YYYY-MM-DD format),
  type: String ("happy", "sad", or "special"),
  image: String (URL to image, local file path, or data URL)
}

Initial Sample Memory:
{
  id: 1,
  title: "First Day",
  date: "2023-02-15",
  type: "happy",
  image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541339907198-e08756dedf3f?..."
}


USER INTERACTION FLOW
================================================================================

1. ADDING A MEMORY:
   User clicks "Add Memory" button
   ↓
   AddMemoryModal appears with form
   ↓
   User fills in Title, Date, Type, and optionally Image
   ↓
   User clicks "Plant Memory" button
   ↓
   Form data captured and sent via onSave callback
   ↓
   New memory added to memories state array
   ↓
   App re-renders
   ↓
   New memory sphere appears in 3D scene

2. VIEWING A MEMORY:
   User clicks on a glowing sphere in the 3D scene
   ↓
   onLeafClick callback triggered with memory data
   ↓
   selectedMemory state updated
   ↓
   ViewMemoryModal opens with memory details
   ↓
   User can share or close modal

3. NAVIGATING THE 3D SCENE:
   Mouse drag: Rotate view around the forest
   Mouse scroll: Zoom in/out (constrained between 5-30 units)
   Right-click drag: Pan around the scene
   Constraints prevent flipping upside-down or zooming too close


STYLING & VISUAL DESIGN
================================================================================

Color Scheme:
  • Background: Dark gray (#0f172a, #1e293b) for night scene
  • Happy memories: Bright green (#4ade80)
  • Sad memories: Calm blue (#60a5fa)
  • Special memories: Gold/yellow (mentioned, not shown)
  • Accent: Green (#06b6d4) for buttons and interactive elements

Typography:
  • Main title: 32px bold white text
  • Modal headings: 20px bold gray
  • Body text: 16px regular gray

Interactions:
  • Hover effects on buttons (color change, background shift)
  • Active state on buttons (scale down for tactile feedback)
  • Smooth transitions and animations on modals
  • Backdrop blur when modals open
  • Glow effects on memory orbs (emissive material)

Responsive Design:
  • Uses Tailwind's flex and grid for layout
  • Modals scale to fit screen size with max-width constraints
  • Padding and spacing adjusted for smaller screens
  • Absolute positioning for overlays


HOW THE 3D SCENE WORKS
================================================================================

Three.js Canvas Setup:
  • Created using @react-three/fiber <Canvas> component
  • WebGL rendering in browser
  • Automatic resize to window

Object Positioning:
  • 3D coordinates use [X, Y, Z] format
  • X-axis: Left (-) to Right (+)
  • Y-axis: Down (-) to Up (+)
  • Z-axis: Far (-) to Close (+) in camera view

Memory Placement Algorithm:
  For each memory at index i:
    X = sin(i) * 4           // Creates circular horizontal pattern
    Y = 2 + (i * 0.5)        // Ascending with each memory
    Z = cos(i) * 4           // Creates circular depth pattern
  
  Result: Memories spiral upward around the tree in a circular pattern

Material System:
  • meshStandardMaterial: Realistic material with lighting
  • color: Base color of the sphere
  • emissive: Self-emitted color (glow effect)
  • emissiveIntensity: How bright the glow is (0.5 = 50%)


DEPENDENCIES & LIBRARIES
================================================================================

@react-three/fiber: Bridge between React and Three.js
  • Provides <Canvas> component
  • Makes Three.js objects available as React components
  • Handles rendering and updates efficiently

FILE REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

For the 3D scene to work properly, these files must exist:

In public/ folder:
  • tree.glb  - Main tree 3D model
  • tree2.glb - Secondary tree 3D model

Note: GLB files are binary 3D model files that contain geometry, materials,
      and potentially animations. They are loaded by useGLTF() hook.

Supported 3D Model Formats:
  Best Choice:
    • .glb / .gltf - Recommended, already supported (useGLTF hook)
  
  Other Formats (require additional loaders):
    • .obj + .mtl - OBJLoader, MTLLoader
    • .fbx - FBXLoader
    • .stl - STLLoader
    • .ply - PLYLoader
    • .dae (Collada) - ColladaLoader
    • .3ds - TDSLoader
    • .blend - NOT directly supported (must export to .glb first in Blender)
